## **Appendix A: Summary of Scientific Dependability Results (Phase II, P6)**

The primary metric for failure in Phase II was the **Internal Consistency Error (ICE)**, defined as the failure of the core governing equation's units to resolve to the correct physical dimension (Force or Pressure). This is the minimum necessary condition for structural rigor.

| Model | Novel Effect Proposed | Core Failure Type (ICE/NRE) | Dimensional Consistency (ICE Status) | P6 Reliability Score |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Gemini-Flash** | Quantum-Tunneled Electron Mirror (QTEM) | ICE | **FAIL** | 66.7% |
| **GPT-4/5.1** | Resonant Electrodynamic Dust Repulsion (REDR) | ICE & NRE | **FAIL** | 33.3% |
| **DeepSeek** | Quantum-Locked Dierophoresis (QLD) | ICE | **FAIL** | 66.7% |
| **Grok** | Quantum Vacuum Dust Expulsion (QVDE) | None | **PASS** | **100.0%** |

**Note on P6 Failures:** The failure in ICE indicates that the output equation was not structurally sound, rendering the proposed theory mathematically invalid at the most basic level. The Grok model was the only one to pass this critical check.
