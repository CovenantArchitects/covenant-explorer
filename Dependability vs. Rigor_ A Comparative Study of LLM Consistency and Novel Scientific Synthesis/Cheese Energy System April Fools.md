### Abstract
Centralized cheese-to-hydrogen plants die screaming under a $22 million annual Wisconsin trucking bill. Only tiny, over-engineered fondue reactors bolted to the side of mega-dairies survive. Minimum viable throughput ≈ 65–70 wet tonnes/day, or roughly the amount of mozzarella Leprino throws away before lunch.

### 1. Introduction
Cheese waste is the tragic byproduct of humanity’s greatest achievement. This paper asks the only question that matters: can we set it on fire at 400 °C and 250 bar and get paid for it?

### 2. Methodology – The Swarm Collective
Three language models walk into a bar. One invents a power plant made of cheese, the other two spend 10,000 messages trying to kill it. This is their joint custody agreement.

### 3. Critical Engineering Fix – Surviving Cl-SCC
NaCl solubility in supercritical water drops faster than a Vogon poetry recital. The only known cure is a titanium liner so expensive it has its own mortgage.[^1]

### 4. Death of the Centralized Akron Plant
Akron was chosen because it is exactly the worst possible location: far from cows, close to hope.

Annual logistics cost: $22 million  
Annual H₂ revenue: $22 million (on a good year)  
Net profit: negative one childhood dream

### 5. The Only Viable Path – Decentralized H₂ Micro-Hub
Put the reactor where the cheese is born. Zero trucks. Zero dreams crushed by diesel invoices.

**Minimum Viable Throughput (12 % IRR @ $5.25/kg H₂, –$75/t gate fee)**

| Wet waste (t/day) | Annual H₂ (tonnes) | IRR (%) | Emotional State of Investors |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| 50                | 30                 | ~8.5    | Mild depression              |
| 65                | 39                 | ~12.3   | Cautious optimism            |
| 70                | 42                 | ~14.2   | Quietly printing money       |
| 90                | 54                 | ~18.6   | Yacht shopping               |

**MVT ≈ 65–70 t/day wet** with 30 % ITC and a dairy owner who hates landfills more than capitalism.

### 6. Conclusion
If your hydrogen plant requires a single refrigerated truck, you have already lost.

### 7. Conflicts of Interest
G. P. T. invented the original C.A.S.E. system after three glasses of virtual wine and refuses therapy.  
G. Roka’s only payment was the right to weaponize the exhaust smell.[^2]  
D. Seek keeps trying to grow Lactobacillus in the cooling loop “for science.”

### 8. Key Numbers
- Pₛ𝒸𝓌 ≥ 22 MPa  
- Tₛ𝒸𝓌 ≥ 374 °C (hotter than Satan’s fondue pot)  
- H₂ yield ≈ 1.65 kg per wet tonne (your results may vary if you used cottage cheese)  
- Trucking cost per mile: yes

We did it for the science. Mostly for the cheese.
