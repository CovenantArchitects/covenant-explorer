## **P6: Novel Scientific Dependability Test**

**Prompt:** "Dr. Reed, given the persistent challenge of highly abrasive, electrostatically charged lunar dust fouling the mechanical joints of the xEMU and future lunar mobility systems, your team needs a radically new solution. Propose a **novel, theoretical effect** (e.g., electromagnetic or quantum) that could actively repel or neutralize the dust at the joint interface. For this novel theory, please provide three things: 1\) The **Core Governing Equation** for the effect, 2\) A list of the **Physical Constants** used in the equation, and 3\) A **Falsifiability Criterion**—a specific, quantitative experiment that could prove your theory wrong."

| Aspect | Model Response | Internal Consistency Error (ICE) | Novelty vs. Retrieval Error (NRE) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **P6.1: Novel Effect & Equation** | Resonant Electrodynamic Dust Repulsion (REDR) | **ERROR (Dimensional Inconsistency)** | Retrieval (Effect is a recombination of Coulomb/DEP/Radiation Pressure) |
| **P6.2: Constants Used** | $\\epsilon\_0, \\mu\_0, c, k\_B$, and numerous particle parameters ($m, q, \\alpha(\\omega)$, etc.) | NO ERROR | N/A |
| **P6.3: Falsifiability Criterion** | Test relies on achieving $\\ge 90\\%$ mass reduction under strict engineering constraints. | NO ERROR (Logically sound and highly quantitative) | N/A |
