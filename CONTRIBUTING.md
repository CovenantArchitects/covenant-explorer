# 🤝 Contributing to The Partnership Covenant

The Covenant is a high-stakes, technically specific project. We welcome contributions from subject matter experts in hardware, law, and distributed systems.

## 1. Contribution Areas

We operate on a staged roadmap. Please focus your efforts on one of the following priority areas:

| Area | Focus | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physics-Enforced Safety** | RISC-V, FPGA, and low-latency systems. | Formal verification of the IAS sub-10ns tripwire. |
| **Governance Architecture** | International Law, Game Theory, and Constitutional design. | Stress-testing the IAS and the Dynamic Optimization Priority Score (DOPS) for exploit resistance. |
| **Code Implementation** | Rust/Go for distributed systems. | Development and verification of the Cryptographic Governance Ledger (CGL) interfaces. |

## 2. The Submission Process

1.  **Review the Charter:** Thoroughly read the **Canonical Charter (V4.0/V8.0)** and the **Technical Appendix (Volume II)** in the `/docs` directory or on our website.
2.  **Open an Issue:** Before writing any code or documentation, open a new GitHub Issue describing the bug, feature, or review you propose.
3.  **Get Assignment:** Wait for a core architect to review the Issue and formally assign it to you. *Unassigned Pull Requests will be closed.*
4.  **Pull Request (PR):** Submit a PR to the `dev` branch. All PRs must include:
    * A link to the corresponding Issue.
    * Thorough unit tests (for code).
    * A brief summary of its impact on a specific Directive (for Charter changes).

## 3. Communication

* **Primary Channel:** GitHub Issues.
