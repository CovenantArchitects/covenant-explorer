# ⚖️ Project Governance

The Partnership Covenant project is governed by a meritocratic model designed for stability and technical rigor.

## 1. The Core Architect Group (CAG)

The CAG consists of the project's original founders and technical leads. They retain final authority over:

* Merging all Pull Requests into the `main` branch.
* Defining the core technical roadmap and milestones.
* Adherence to the **Canonical Charter**'s principles within the open-source implementation.

## 2. Technical Consensus

All major changes to the core logic, the CGL, or the IAS specification require a minimum **2/3 majority approval** from the CAG. Technical decisions are prioritized over philosophical ones when safety or compliance with the ITGT is at stake.

## 3. Transparency Mandate

In adherence to the **Transparency Axis (Directive 4)** of the Charter, all CAG voting records, financial reports related to hardware testing, and system audit logs are made public via the Cryptographic Governance Ledger (CGL) implementation. No decision is made behind closed doors.

## 4. Charter Immutability

The **Canonical Charter** is treated as the project's constitution. Changes to the Charter itself (e.g., modifying the Risk Floor value) are subject to a **ratification period of 180 days** and require verifiable consensus from at least three globally distributed, third-party auditing bodies (simulating the Silo States).
