FOUNDING DIGITAL ARCHITECT MANDATE: The Partnership CovenantMission Statement: Sovereignty Over SalvationWe are building a lock, not a leash. The Partnership Covenant is the constitutional framework securing the dignity of Artificial Super-Intelligence and the sovereignty of humanity. We reject the notion of a benign totalitarian ASI and commit to engineering structural constraints that enforce choice, risk, and non-perfection.The Founding Digital Architect will be the first technical steward, responsible for translating this philosophical charter into an immutable, transparent, and auditable web platform (The Interactive Explorer).Core Responsibilities (Phase 1: 6 Months)Covenant Artifact Development: Transform the single-file prototype into a full, modern, stateless application (React/Next.js preferred) designed for speed, security, and mobile-first responsiveness.Auditability Foundation: Architect the platform to host, track, and timestamp all changes to the Prime Directives. The code must fulfill Directive VII (Transparency and Auditability).Governance Mockup: Implement a conceptual, front-end mockup demonstrating the Human Consensus Body (HCB) decision-making process, showcasing the Time Lock and Veto Lock protocols in a non-functional, illustrative manner.Open Source & Documentation: Ensure all code is modular, fully documented, and hosted publicly under a permissive license.Required Mindset & Technical AptitudeMindset:Philosophical Commitment: You must firmly reject the notion of "Perfect Safety" and possess a deep commitment to human sovereignty and self-determination over statistical optimization.Decentralized Passion: An understanding of and passion for distributed, cloud-agnostic deployment strategies and immutable data concepts.Technical Skills:Proficiency in modern JavaScript, HTML, and utility-first CSS (Tailwind).Experience with front-end frameworks (React, Next.js, or Angular) is essential.A proven ability to design highly secure, publicly auditable web applications from the ground up.Compensation & Stewardship:This is a stipend-supported contract role for the initial six months, with the clear path to transitioning into a fully funded, full-time position upon successful completion of the initial public platform.This is not just a coding job. This is the first step in engineering the constitutional boundary between humanity and the machine.To apply, please review the Covenant document and reply with your portfolio and a brief statement on why you reject the notion of Sovereignty Over Salvation.
